# The :development dependency set is way too broad for our needs: for most Gems,
# it includes test tools and development aids that aren't necessary for just
# building the Gem. It's hard to even get a stratum if we include all these
# tools because of the number of circular dependencies. Instead, only those
# tools which are known to be required at Gem build time are listed as
# build-dependencies, and any other :development dependencies are ignored.
#
# This list is currently empty, because everything that was in it has been
# added to the 'ruby' stratum and so is present implicitly.

# List of Gems which are built into Ruby or included in the 'ruby' stratum

# This doesn't take the versions that are provided into account (and it'd be
# quite a maintenance burden if it did). Thus it's not an ideal solution, as
# something may for example depend on Rake 4.9 when Rake 2.0 is actually the
# only thing available and this won't be noticed until the user tries to build
# the generated definitions.
