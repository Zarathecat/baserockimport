.TH BASEROCK-IMPORT 1
.SH NAME
baserock-import \- convert data from software packaging systems into Baserock definitions

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SH DESCRIPTION

The tool helps you generate Baserock build instructions by importing metadata
from a foreign packaging system.
.PP
The process it follows is this:
.PP
.TP
1.
Pick a package from the processing queue.
.TP
2.
Find its source code, and generate a suitable .lorry file.
.TP
3.
Make it available as a local Git repo.
.TP
4.
Check out the commit corresponding to the requested version of the package.
.TP
5.
Analyse the source tree and generate a suitable chunk .morph to build the requested package.
.TP
6.
Analyse the source tree and generate a list of dependencies for the package.
.TP
7.
Enqueue any new dependencies, and repeat.
.PP
Once the queue is empty:
.PP
.TP
8.
Generate a stratum .morph for the package(s) the user requested.
.PP
The tool is not magic. It can be taught the conventions for each packaging
system, but these will not work in all cases. When an import fails it will
continue to the next package, so that the first run does as many imports as
possible.
.PP
For imports that could not be done automatically, you will need to write an
appropriate .lorry or .morph file manually and rerun the tool. It will resume
processing where it left off.
.PP
The following information can also be found in the README file in the tool's
source repository.
