Omnibus import
==============

See 'README' for general information on the Baserock Import Tool.

To use
------

First, clone the Git repository corresponding to the Omnibus project you want
to import. For example, if you want to import the Chef Server, clone:
<https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef-server>

As per Omnibus' instructions, you should then run `bundle install --binstubs`
in the checkout to make available the various dependent repos and Gems of the
project definitions.
