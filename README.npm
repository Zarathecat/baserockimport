You need to set NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules/ to use this importer!!!!!
eg: your command could look like:

NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules/ baserock-import npm PACKAGENAME [version]

The default (and strongly encouraged) behavour of npm is to install the
modules that a program depends on inside the source tree of the project,
in a subdirectory called 'node_modules'. The authors of npm are pretty
against globally installing packages that other packages depend on. There
is a 'install --global' option which seems to be only for programs that
you want available in /usr/bin.

npm's FAQ responds to the question of how to have globally installed
packages, with "Write your own package manager, then.  ItÂ´s not that hard.".
OK! And we could have done that, but we found that by (ab)using the `npm build`
command it's possible to get npm to install a package into
/usr/lib/node_modules without installing its dependencies. This is consistent
with how Baserock (and pretty much every other Linux distribution) tries
to do things. Node.js doesn't seem to have a built-in 'look for modules here'
path, so you'll need to set NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules when running
programs that use the packages installed in the Baserock system.
